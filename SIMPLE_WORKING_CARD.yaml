# Simple Working Card - Copy this YAML to your dashboard

# First, try this basic card to see what entities exist:
type: entities
title: üîç Debug - Available Entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.iphone_monitor_status
    name: "iPhone Monitor Status"
  - entity: sensor.apple_store_stock_available  
    name: "Stock Available (Old Name)"
  - entity: binary_sensor.iphone_stock_found
    name: "Stock Found"
  - entity: binary_sensor.apple_store_stock_available
    name: "Stock Available Binary (Old Name)"
  - entity: sensor.apple_store_last_check
    name: "Last Check"

# If the above doesn't work, try this minimal version:
type: auto-entities
card:
  type: entities
  title: üì± All Apple Store Entities
filter:
  include:
    - entity_id: "*apple_store*"
    - entity_id: "*iphone*"
  exclude: []

# Manual entity card (replace with actual entity names):
type: entities
title: üì± iPhone Stock Monitor
entities:
  # Replace these with the actual entity names you see in Developer Tools
  - sensor.YOUR_ACTUAL_ENTITY_NAME_HERE
  - binary_sensor.YOUR_ACTUAL_ENTITY_NAME_HERE
